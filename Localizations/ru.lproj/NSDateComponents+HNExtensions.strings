 The translation follows few simple rules
 1) "key" is used as key for the singular form and as the final fallback
 2) "key##plural" is used for values above 1 as the first fallback (if 3 or 4 are not there)
 3) "key##x{value}" is used for values above 1 with the results of number % 10,
 i.e the last digit of the number, for example with count 21 minutes, this key would be "minute##x1"
 3) "key##{value}" is the first key that is checked, for example "minute##3"
 can be the key for "minutes" as that goes along with count 3
