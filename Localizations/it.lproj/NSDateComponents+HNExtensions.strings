/* 
 NSDateComponents+HNExtensions.strings
 
 The translation follows few simple rules
 1) "key" is used as key for the singular form and as the final fallback
 2) "key##plural" is used for values above 1 as the first fallback (if 3 is not there)
 3) "key##{value}" is the first key that is checked, for example "minute##3"
 can be the key for "minutes" as that goes along with count 3
